Where can host QuickWiki?

Well, really, anywhere you want. This very page you are on now is hosted over IPFS for example.

All platforms that have been tested and confirmed working:

* IPFS
* Amazon S3
* self-hosted nginx
* Github Pages
* Anywhere where you can manage to upload a directory of HTML files
