This page lists some differences between some wikis

### Mediawiki

Huge! Mediawiki is for large, collaborative wikis. QuickWiki is for medium, personal
or interorganization wikis. MediaWiki requires a database and PHP-server. QuickWiki
requires any webserver that can serve files. Mediawiki has history and real
extensions. QuickWiki has history via plugins but only fake (need to exist on
build-time) plugins.

### DocWiki

Similar goals, different implementations. DocWiki requires PHP server. QuickWiki
requires only a webserver that can serve files. DocWiki has UI for edition.
In QuickWiki you need to work directly with files (or write a plugin for editing!)
